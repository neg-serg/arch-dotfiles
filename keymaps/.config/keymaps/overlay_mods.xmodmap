!! swap Alt_L with Super_L (my preferred window-manager Mod)
!! this keeps Super_L closer to the thumb
!! also make Alt_R=Win and Menu=Alt_R
remove Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R
remove Mod4 = Super_L
keycode 133 = Alt_L
keycode 64 = Super_L
keysym Menu = Alt_R
keysym Alt_R = Super_L
add Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R
add Mod4 = Super_L

!! remove [useless] Caps_Lock action..
!! clone Control_L into Caps_Lock instead
!remove lock = Caps_Lock
!keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
!add lock = Caps_Lock
!add control = Control_L
