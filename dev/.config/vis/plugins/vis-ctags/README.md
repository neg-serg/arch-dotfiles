# vis-ctags
Basic ctags support for the [vis editor](https://github.com/martanne/vis).

## Usage
The plugin should first of all be [enabled](https://github.com/martanne/vis/wiki/Plugins). The tags file is required to be generated with the `-n` option. To look up the word under cursor in a new window, use `Ctrl+]`. To choose in a list of tag matches, use `g+Ctrl+]`.

## Limitations
There may be some generic or language-specific issues. If you find one, or you have an idea of how to improve something, feel free to send a patch or create a pull request.
