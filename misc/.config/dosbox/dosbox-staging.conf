#                   Press Alt-Enter to switch back to window.
#          display: Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings.
#   fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
#                   or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
# windowresolution: Set window size to be used when running in windowed mode:
#                     default:   Select the best option based on your
#                                environment and other settings.
#                     original:  Resize window to the resolution picked by
#                                the emulated program.
#                     resizable: Make the emulator window resizable.
#                                This is an experimental option, works only with
#                                output=opengl and glshader=sharp (or none)
#                     <custom>:  Scale the window content to the indicated
#                                dimensions, in WxH format. For example: 1024x768.
#                                Scaling is not performed for output=surface.
#           output: What video system to use for output.
#                   Possible values: surface, texture, texturenb, texturepp, opengl, openglnb.

#                   Possible values: auto, opengl, opengles2, software.
#    capture_mouse: Choose a mouse control method:
#                      onclick:        The mouse will be captured after the first
#                                      click inside the window.
#                      onstart:        The mouse is captured immediately on start
#                                      (similar to real DOS).
#                      seamless:       The mouse can move seamlessly in and out of DOSBox
#                                      window and cannot be captured.
#                      nomouse:        The mouse is disabled and hidden without any
#                                      input sent to the game.
#                   Choose how middle-clicks are handled (second parameter):
#                      middlegame:     Middle-clicks are sent to the game
#                                      (Ctrl-F10 uncaptures the mouse).
#                      middlerelease:  Middle-clicks are used to uncapture the mouse
#                                      (not sent to the game). However, middle-clicks
#                                      will be sent to the game in fullscreen or when
#                                      seamless control is set.
#                                      Ctrl-F10 will also uncapture the mouse.
#                   Defaults (if not present or incorrect): seamless middlerelease
#                   Possible values: seamless, onclick, onstart, nomouse.
#      sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#      waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
#         priority: Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
#                   pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                   Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#       mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from.
#                   Resetmapper only works with the default value.

#           This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,

[render]
# frameskip: How many frames DOSBox skips before drawing one.
#    aspect: Scales the vertical resolution to produce a 4:3 display aspect
#            ratio, matching that of the original standard-definition monitors
#            for which the majority of DOS games were designed. This setting
#            only affects video modes that use non-square pixels, such as
#            320x200 or 640x400; where as square-pixel modes, such as 640x480
#            and 800x600, will be displayed as-is.
#    scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes.
#            If 'forced' is appended, then the scaler will be used even if
#            the result might not be desired.
#            Note that some scalers may use black borders to fit the image
#            within your configured display resolution. If this is
#            undesirable, try either a different scaler or enabling
#            fullresolution output.

#  glshader: Path to GLSL shader source to use with OpenGL output ("none" to disable).
#            Can be either an absolute path, a file in the "glshaders" subdirectory

#    cycles: Amount of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
#            Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
#            Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#              'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                              It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#              'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
#                              need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#              'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                              handle.
#            Possible values: auto, fixed, max.

#             (find the id/name with mixer/listmidi).
#             Or in the case of coreaudio, you can specify a soundfont here.
#             When using a Roland MT-32 rev. 0 as midi output device, some games may require a delay in order to prevent 'buffer overflow' issues.
#             In that case, add 'delaysysex', for example: midiconfig=2 delaysysex

#          Possible values: default, compat, fast, mame, nuked.
