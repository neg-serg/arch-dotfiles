Novocaine Mausoleum was a band from post-USSR playing batcave/gothic/deathrock. With a flair for the dramatic and bizarre, they made an interesting addition to the underground gothic landscape. Their sound echoes the abandoned grandeur of the former Russian Empire, from gilded grand palaces to desolate ruins of factories. Influences like Cinema Strange can clearly be heard on their 6-track demo. Novocaine Mausoleum has disbanded on 08.08.2008.
